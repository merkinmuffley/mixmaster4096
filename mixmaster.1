.SH DESCRIPTION
Mixmaster is an anonymous remailer. Remailers provide protection
against traffic analysis and allow sending mail anonymously or
pseudonymously.
.PP
In the non-interactive mode, Mixmaster reads a message from its
standard input or from a file.  Destination address and input file can
be specified in the command line.  If no address is given in the
command line, the input file is expected to contain a message complete
with mail headers.

.SS Remailer options:
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-read\-mail
Read a remailer message from standard input and store it in the pool.
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-store\-mail
Read a remailer message from standard input and store it in the pool
without decrypting it immediately. It will be processed the next time
Mixmaster processes the queue (called with \fP-M\fP or in daemon mode).
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-pop-mail
Read mail from the POP3 servers listed in
.BR pop3.cfg .
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-remailer
Check if it is time to perform the regular remailer actions:
Send messages from the pool, get mail from POP3 servers and keep the
internal files up\-to\-date.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-daemon
Detach from the console and process the pool, get mail and update the
internal files at regular intervals.
.TP
.B \-\-no-detach
Run as daemon but do not detach from the terminal (This option is
only useful together with \fB--daemon\fP).
.TP
.B -G, \-\-generate\-key
Generate a new remailer key.  RSA key sizes 1024, 2048, 3072 and 4096 are possible (--size=2048).
Key lifetime in days may be specified (--lifetime=ndays).  Expired secret keys are
automatically deleted next time mixmaster runs.  Some balance should be sought between
having high turnover with concurrent keys (e.g. daily generation of --lifetime=14) and 
having keys of long lifetime not quickly destroyed.

.TP
.B \-K, \-\-update\-keys
Generate remailer keys if necessary.
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-send
Force sending the message(s) from the pool.
.TP
.B \-\-install\-svc
Install the Mixmaster Service on Win32.
.TP
.B \-\-remove\-svc
Remove the Mixmaster Service on Win32.
.TP
.B \-\-run\-svc
Run the Mixmaster Service on Win32.
.TP
.B \-\-redirect
Read a Mixmaster packet from stdin and route it through a chain given with
.B \-\-no\-ask\-passphrase
Do not ask for the remailer passphrase even if we don't have it compiled in,
don't have it in the config file, don't have it in the environment and we are
on a tty.
\fB\-\-chain\fP.
Note that this may corrupt the packet if there is not enough space in the
headers (that is, if there are more than 20 hops total).  This function is
not normally needed but may come in handy in certain cases.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Mixmaster reads its configuration from the file
.B mix.cfg
in its working directory.  The configuration file consists of lines of
the type
.PP
.I VARIABLE       values
.PP
and of comments, which begin with a
.B #
character.  The variables have reasonable default values, but it is
useful to create a configuration file using the
.B Install
script when setting up a remailer.
.PP
All configuration variables can be overridden from the command line,
e.g.
.B mixmaster -S --POOLSIZE=0 --RATE=100
will send all messages currently in the message pool.

.TP
.B ERRLOG
Name of a file to log error messages, or
.B stdout
or
.BR stderr .
Default:
.BR stderr .
(When run from a tty, Mixmaster will always print a copy of error
messages to
.BR stderr .)
.TP
.B MAILBOX
A generic mail folder for non-remailer messages that are not stored in
any of the following folders.
If
.B MAILBOX
begins with a
.BR | ,
it specifies the path to a program. If it contains an
.B @
sign, the message is forwarded to the given address (with an
.B X-Loop:
header to prevent mail loops). If it ends with a
.B /
it is treated as a Maildir, otherwise the message is appended
to the given file name or written to standard output if
.B MAILBOX
is
.BR stdout .
Default:
.BR mbox .
.TP

.TP
.B MAILBOUNCE
Mail folder for bounce messages. Default:
.IR MAILBOX .
.TP
.B MAILIN
If defined an additional mail folder where Mixmaster should read messages from
when processing its pool. If it ends with a
.B /
it is treated as a Maildir, otherwise a standard mbox format file
is expected. All messages are removed from the folder after reading.
.B MAILIN
is not set by default.
It is an incredibly bad idea to set this the same as \fBMAILBOX\fP.
.TP
.B VERBOSE
If
.B VERBOSE
is set to
.BR 0 ,
Mixmaster will log error
messages only. If it is set to
.BR 1 ,
error messages and warnings are logged. If
.B VERBOSE
is set to
.BR 2 ,
successful operation is logged as well.
If set to
.BR 3 ,
a log file entry is created whenever a message
enters or leaves the pool.  Default:
.BR 2 .
.TP
.B PASSPHRASE
A passphrase used to protect the remailer secret keys from
casual attackers. This setting overrides the compile-time
defined
.B COMPILEDPASS
which is now deprecated.
This should
.I not
be the same as the client passphrase.
.TP
.B EXTFLAGS
Additional flags you want to set in the remailer's capabilities string.
Defaults to the empty string, which means none.  Example:
.BR testing .
.TP
.B PRECEDENCE
Sets the header Precedence: to this value for all outgoing mail.
Defaults to the empty string, which means no such header is added.
Example: 
.BR anon .
If you use this you might want to block user supplied precedence
headers in your header block file.
.PP
The following variables can be set to
.B y
or
.BR n :
.TP
.B REMAIL
Enable remailer functionality. Default:
.BR n .
.TP
.B MIDDLEMAN
Act as an intermediate hop only, forward anonymized
messages to another remailer. This mode can be used
where complaints about anonymous messages must be
avoided. (The variable
.B FORWARDTO
specifies the remailer
chain to be used; default:
.BR * .)
Default:
.BR n .
.TP
.B AUTOREPLY
Send help files in response to non-remailer messages. Explicit
.B remailer-help
requests are always served.
Default:
.BR n .
.TP
.B MIX
Accept Mixmaster messages. Default:
.BR y .
.TP
.B PGP
Accept OpenPGP-encrypted Cypherpunk remailer messages.
Default:
.BR n .
.TP
.B UNENCRYPTED
Accept unencrypted Cypherpunk remailer messages.
Default:
.BR n .
.TP
.B REMIX
Re-encrypt Type I messages to other remailers in the Mixmaster format
.RB ( x
= only when requested by user explicitly).
Default:
.BR y .
.TP
.B BINFILTER
Filter out binary attachments. Default:
.BR n .
.TP
.B LISTSUPPORTED
List known remailers and their keys in remailer-conf reply. Default:
.BR y .
.TP
.B MID
Use a hash of the message body as Message-ID, to avoid
Usenet spam. Default:
.BR y .
If
.B MID
is set to a string
beginning with
.BR @ ,
that string is used as the domain part of the message ID.
.TP
.B AUTOBLOCK
Allow users to add their address to the
.B dest.blk
file by sending the remailer a message containing the line
.BR destination-block .
Default:
.BR y .
.TP
.B STATSDETAILS
List statistics on intermediate vs. final delivery in remailer-stats.
Default:
.BR y .
.PP
The following variables have numeric values:
.TP
.B POOLSIZE
The size of the Mixmaster reordering pool. Larger sizes
imply higher security and longer delays. Remailer default:
.BR 45 .
Client default:
.BR 0 .
.TP
.B RATE
Percentage of messages from the pool to be sent. Remailer default:
.BR 65 .
Client default:
.BR 100 .
Lower values cause the pool to increase in size when
many messages are received at a time, reducing the effect
of flooding attacks.
.TP
.B INDUMMYP
Probability that Mixmaster will generate dummy messages upon
receipt of incoming mail. Larger numbers mean more dummy
messages on average. For instance,
.B 10
means that on average one in nine incoming messages will trigger
a dummy generation, and
.B 20
means that one in four will.
.B 0
means no dummy messages. Remailer default:
.BR 10 .
Client default:
.BR 3 .
.TP
.B OUTDUMMYP
Probability that Mixmaster will generate dummy messages at
.B SENDPOOL
time. If the pool is processed frequently, this should be a lower value
than if there are long intervals between pool processing. Examples:
.B 50
means on average, one dummy message will be generated per pool
processing.
.B 80
means four will be generated.
.B 0
means no dummy messages. Remailer default:
.BR 90 .
Client default:
.BR 3 .
.TP
.B SIZELIMIT
Maximum size for anonymous messages in kB.
.B 0
means no limit.
Default:
.BR 0 .
.TP
.B POP3SIZELIMIT
Maximum size for incoming messages in kB when using POP3.
.B 0
means no limit.
Default:
.BR 0 .
Larger messages are deleted unread if
.B POP3DEL
is set to
.BR y ,
and left on the server otherwise.
.TP
.B INFLATEMAX
Maximum size for
.B Inflate:
padding in kB.
.B 0
means padding is not allowed.
Default:
.B 50
.BR kB .
.TP
.B MAXRANDHOPS
Maximum chain length for message forwarding requested by
.B Rand-Hop
directives.
Default:
.BR 4 .
.TP
.B MAXRECIPIENTS
limits the number of allowed recipients in outgoing mail.  Anything that exceeds this
number is dropped silently.  Default:
.BR 5 .
.TP
.B KEYLEN
Define the default Mixmaster key length.  This can be overridden by using --size in
combination with --generate-key.
Acceptable values are: 1=1024, 2=2048, 3=3072, 4=4096.  Default:
.BR 1 .
.TP
.B TEMP_FAIL
exit with this exit code when a timeskew problem is suspected.  Also see
.BR TIMESKEW_BACK
and
.BR TIMESKEW_FORWARD .
The default of
.B 75
should cause your MTA to requeue the message if you are running
mixmaster from a
.BR .forward
file.
.TP
.B STATSAUTOUPDATE
Set non-zero to enable Daemon stats download mode. Default: 
.BR 0 .
.PP
The following are time variables. They can be given as years (
.BR y
), months (
.BR b
), days (
.BR d
), hours (
.BR h
), minutes (
.BR m
), or seconds (
.BR s
).
.TP
.B SENDPOOLTIME
How often Mixmaster should check the pool for messages
to be sent. Remailer default:
.BR 15m .
Client default:
.BR 0h .
.TP
.B POP3TIME
How often Mixmaster should check the POP3 accounts
listed in
.B pop3.cfg
for new mail.
Default:
.BR 1h .
.TP
.B MAILINTIME
How often Mixmaster should read mail from
.BR MAILIN
and process mails fetched via POP3. Processing here means to
answer remailer-xxx requests and decrypt messages to the Mixmaster
and place them in the pool. No other processing of the pool is
done. This action is always performed sending out messages from the pool (at
.BR SENDPOOLTIME
intervals) or receiving mail via POP3 (at
.BR POP3TIME
intervals). Default:
.BR 5m .
.TP
.B PACKETEXP
How long to store parts of incomplete multipart messages and other
temporary pool files.
Default:
.BR 7d .
.TP
.B IDEXP
Mixmaster keeps a log of packet IDs to prevent replay
attacks.
.B IDEXP
specifies after which period of time old
IDs are expired. Default:
.BR 7d ,
minimum:
.BR 5d .
If set to
.BR 0 ,
no log is kept.
.TP
.B KEYLIFETIME
Mixmaster sets an expiration date on its remailer keys 
.B KEYLIFETIME
after the key creation date. Default:
.BR 13b .
.TP
.B KEYGRACEPERIOD
Mixmaster will continue to decrypt messages encrypted to an expired key 
for
.B KEYGRACEPERIOD 
period of time after the expiration. This is done to ensure that messages
already injected into the network are allowed to exit. Do not change this
value unless you know what you are doing, or you will risk partitioning
attacks. Default:
.BR 7d . 
.TP
.B KEYOVERLAPPERIOD
Mixmaster will generate and advertise a new key 
.BR KEYOVERLAPPERIOD
period of time before the expiration of the key. Clients should always use 
the most recently created valid key. Clients that deviate from this 
recommended behavior risk partitioning attacks. Default:
.BR 7d .
.TP
.B TIMESKEW_BACK
Allow going back up to
.BR TIMESKEW_BACK
in time.  If the time moved further back mixmaster will assume
there is a problem with your clock and refuse to start as a remailer.
This is done by comparing the latest timestamp in 
.BR time.log
with the current timestamp.  If set to
.BR 0
then this test is skipped.  If the system time is indeed correct, simply
remove
.BR time.log .
Default: 
.BR 12h .
.TP
.B TIMESKEW_FORWARD
Similar to
.BR TIMESKEW_BACK
but allow jumping this far into the future.
Default: 
.BR 2w .
.TP
.B STATSINTERVAL
Time interval between daemon downloads of stats files. Enabled by
.BR STATSAUTOUPDATE .
Default: 
.BR 2h .

.BR config.h .
It is not usually necessary to modify any of these:
.TP
.B
DISCLAIMER
A default string to be inserted in the header of all anonymous
messages if no
.B disclaim.txt
file is available. If
.B DISCLAIMER
contains the substring
.BR "%s" ,
it will be substituted with the
.I COMPLAINTS
address.
.TP
.B FROMDISCLAIMER
A default string to be inserted at the top of the message body
if an anonymous message contains a user-supplied
.B From:

to set a passphrase. This should
.I not
be the same as the client passphrase. This option is now deprecated in
favor of the configuration file option
.BR PASSPHRASE .
.TP
.B SPOOL
Set
.B SPOOL
if you want to use a default directory other than

exists, recipients are logged and a reply is sent only once to avoid
mail loops (\fBUSAGEFILE\fP).
.TP
.B blocked.txt
Information sent in response to automatically processed blocking requests if
.B AUTOREPLY
is set (\fBBLOCKFILE\fP).
.TP
.B pop3.cfg
List of POP3 accounts with lines of the form
.I account@host.domain password
to get remailer messages from. The lines may optionally contain the
keyword "apop" or "pass" to select an authentication method (\fBPOP3CONF\fP).
.TP
.B dest.alw
List of addresses to which Mixmaster will deliver, even in middleman mode (\fBDESTALLOW\fP).
.TP
.B dest.alw.nonpublished
Similar to
.BR dest.alw ,
with the only difference that this list is not published in remailer-conf replies (\fBDESTALLOW2\fP).
.TP
.B dest.blk
List of blocked destination addresses.
Mixmaster does not send mail to the blocked addresses listed in this file (\fBDESTBLOCK\fP).
.TP
.B rab.blk
Identical to
.BR dest.blk ,
except Mixmaster will not write to this file.
For use with external remailer abuse blocklists.
.TP
.B source.blk
List of blocked source addresses.  If an incoming message originates
from an address or IP in this list, it will be ignored. This
feature can be used to avoid spam and other abusive mail (\fBSOURCEBLOCK\fP).
.TP
.B header.blk
List of unwanted header fields. The file is used to delete unwanted
header lines (e.g. lines that indicate a false identity, or Usenet
control messages), and do other header filtering (\fBHDRFILTER\fP).

A destination address or header line is left out if it contains a
search string or matches a regular expression specified in the block
file. Lines in the block file that begin and end with a slash
.RB ( /\fIregexp\fB/ )
are interpreted as regular expressions. Lines without
slashes are used for case-independent substring search.

If a message contains a header line that matches a
.B /\fIregexp\fB/q
entry in
.BR header.blk ,
the entire message is deleted.

In addition, regular expressions can be substituted. Back-references
are supported. For example

 /^From: *([^@]*) <.*>/From: $1/
 /^From:.* \\(([^@]*)\)/From: $1/
 /^From: *([^@]*).*$/From: $1 <\fInobody@remailer.domain\fR>/

would allow user-defined names in the
.B From:
line, while replacing any given address with the remailer address.
.TP
.B allpingers.txt
Information on all known pingers (\fBALLPINGERSFILE\fP).
.SS
Mixmaster uses the following files internally:
.TP
.B mixrand.bin

.SH HISTORY
Mixmaster is an implementation of a Chaumian mix-net system.
Versions 1.0 through 2.0.3 of the 
.BR mixmaster
remailer were originally written by Lance Cottrell. Mixmaster was first 
released in 1995. Ulf Moeller collaborated on version 2.0.4, and began an 
entire rewrite of
.BR mixmaster
in 1999. This rewrite was released in 2002 as version 2.9.0, with major 
contributions from Janis Jagars, Peter Palfrader, and Len Sassaman.
Mixmaster 3.1 is based on the 2.9 codebase. Peter Palfrader and Len 
Sassaman were the principal maintainers until 2006. Since then, Steve 
Crook, Len Sassaman, and Colin Tuckley have filled the role of 
principal maintaners. For more information on contributing authors, 
please see the file THANKS for details.
